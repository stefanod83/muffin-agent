#!/usr/bin/env bash
# DAY-1 A11 — install Muffin on an empty Ubuntu box without inheriting the
# runner's home or service manager.
#
# This script is the *proof*, not the installer. It rehearses the claim end to
# end on a machine that has never seen Muffin: no Node, no checkout, no
# `~/.muffin`, nothing but Ubuntu and a non-root user with sudo. It is written
# to run on GitHub Actions' `ubuntu-latest` runner, which is the hosted place
# this Linux-specific claim is tested —
# the claim is about Linux, and the developer machines are Macs. "Linux prima,
# macOS poi".
#
# ## What "an empty machine" means here, concretely
#
# The Actions runner already has Node installed by `actions/setup-node`, so
# simply running the installer would prove nothing about the prerequisite it is
# supposed to solve. So this script builds a **clean PATH** out of the system
# directories only, dropping any that contains a `node`/`npm`, and refuses to
# continue unless `node` really is unreachable under it. Everything the
# installer does afterwards happens under that PATH, in a throwaway `HOME`.
#
# The repository under test is served to the installer through a **local bare
# git repo**, not GitHub: the point is to exercise `install.sh`'s clone/build/
# link path and `muffin update`'s `.releases/<sha>` path against *this commit*,
# and a fetch of github.com/main would silently test a different tree.
#
# ## What this eval cannot prove, declared and not papered over
#
# This eval owns a throwaway HOME. A host's user systemd manager belongs to its
# real login home and cannot supervise the unit written into this lab. So the
# eval gives its subprocesses a private, absent user-bus socket and proves the
# supervisor half in two pieces instead of accidentally querying the host's
# unrelated manager:
#
#   · `systemd-analyze verify` on the unit `muffin gateway install` actually
#     wrote — systemd's own parser, so a malformed or unloadable unit is red;
#   · the unit's own `ExecStart`, run in the foreground, until
#     `muffin gateway status` reports a live pid — which is the thing systemd
#     would have done, minus systemd.
#
# This deliberately does not prove that a service is active under systemd or
# survives logout. That needs a separate disposable VM with a user manager
# configured for this HOME; a green here proves the no-user-bus install path.
#
# ## The provider key
#
# `muffin init` needs one and this script has none, so it writes a syntactically
# valid but useless Anthropic-shaped key into a file and lets `install.sh` pipe
# it in. That is enough for every check below: nothing here makes a model call.
# It travels by file and stdin — never argv, never the environment — because
# that is the only path `cmdInit` accepts (ADR-0048), and this script must not
# be the place where that stops being true.
#
# Usage:  bash evals/install/ubuntu.sh [path-to-repo]      (default: git toplevel)
