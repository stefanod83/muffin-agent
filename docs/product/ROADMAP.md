# Roadmap

This document owns one question only:

> **If a capability or architectural idea is deliberately not required now, in which product phase should it be reconsidered?**

It does **not** own implementation status, DAY-1 truth, architecture or sequencing of current work.

- Selected initiatives and their live work status (Now / Next / Later / Exploring) are the
  [Muffin roadmap project](https://github.com/orgs/muffin-project/projects/2).
- DAY-1 status belongs to `docs/status/day1/requirements-status.md`.
- Remaining DAY-1 order belongs to `docs/status/day1/critical-path.md`.
- Current work belongs to observed Git/GitHub state.
- Semantic shape belongs to `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` / `docs/architecture/SECURITY.md` and ADRs.
- Public/community strategy belongs to `docs/project/OPEN-SOURCE-STRATEGY.md`.

A phase placement is a commitment to **revisit**, not a promise to implement. Dogfood evidence may promote, demote or delete an item.

### DAY-1 READY

DAY-1 is intentionally not duplicated here. `docs/status/day1/readiness-criteria.md` and the reconciled DAY-1 requirements decide what must exist before the fourteen-day window starts.

Architecture work may expose a new DAY-1 candidate; that candidate enters the DAY-1 requirements rather than being silently implemented from this roadmap.

Current architecture findings that must be reconciled into DAY-1 include the owner-required **smart Telegram interaction**: surface-aware event composition, multipart/multimodal input (including multiple files/images and voice), and continued ingress while current work is running. The exact DAY-1 classification belongs to `docs/status/day1/requirements-status.md`.

### 14-day owner dogfood

This phase is primarily an observation window, not a preloaded feature sprint.

Record and count:

- fallbacks to another general-purpose agent;
- input/UX friction and incorrect grouping/steering;
- missing capabilities that interrupt real work;
- memory misses, wrong beliefs and duplicate/conflicting beliefs;
- ASK fatigue and unsafe-looking effects;
- retries/recovery failures;
- ignored or annoying proactive behaviour;
- context/latency/cost pressure;
- tool-catalogue pressure: a needed capability exists but is not exposed, or the model repeatedly chooses the wrong tool as breadth grows;
- reasons the owner reaches for another device/interface.

Observed repeated pain outranks speculative roadmap items below.

**Freeze cognitive growth by default during this window.** A new salience,
decay, person-model, consolidation, ranking or other cognitive mechanism needs an
observed failure it is meant to fix and a way to tell whether it helped. A
mechanism does not earn a place merely because it is plausible or inspired by a
paper. Simplifying or deleting harness that no longer earns its cost is a valid
dogfood result.

Likewise, do not turn the current numeric tool-exposure cap into architecture.
Measure whether catalogue breadth actually hurts selection or hides needed
capabilities before adding discovery/deferred-loading machinery.

## MVP / trusted alpha

These are the strongest post-DAY-1 candidates. They are not automatically required before dogfood.

### Installation, deployment and runtime direction (reconciled from #481)

Owner direction captured 2026-09-08, placed here 2026-09-28. The executable
onboarding outcome stays in #507; the Home/Node/Surface distinction stays in
`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` and ADR-0050.

- **Three concerns, not one.** `install` guarantees a runnable `muffin`; the
  first run configures the owner's Muffin (#507); the deployment choice decides
  where Home runs continuously. They compose; they are not one conceptual step.
- **Deployment follows the role of the machine (MVP / trusted alpha).** Personal
  Mac/PC as Home prefers native installation — local capabilities (filesystem,
  processes, notifications, Keychain, local inference) under Muffin authority.
  A VPS Home supports native and Docker, with Docker as the likely reproducible
  default once proven. Docker is an official deployment/execution option, not
  the universal architecture: the personal Home is not containerized by default
  when that immediately requires broad host mounts and privileged escapes. An
  experimental contributor Compose path exists (PR #729); it is not a product
  promise.
- **Node is a different axis** from Home and Surface. Deployment answers where
  Home runs, Node where a capability executes, Surface where the owner talks.
  The Node protocol is not implemented yet and ADR-0050 owns it; this file only
  keeps the placement.
- **TypeScript core stays; Python may compute (MVP / trusted alpha,
  capability-by-capability).** Canonical semantics, authority and durable state
  stay in the TypeScript core. A Python compute worker is acceptable behind a
  narrow typed local boundary for capabilities that measurably become simpler or
  materially better there (PII/NER, embeddings, reranking, speech, vision/OCR,
  ML evaluation). Invariant: **Python may compute; it does not become a second
  Home or a second semantic writer.** Packaging hides the runtime (e.g. `uv`);
  the owner installs Muffin, not a toolchain. Promote per capability with the
  integration-cost/latency measurement #481 named — no generic plugin framework
  first.
- **Privacy egress (hypothesis, not a policy change).** A local reversible PII
  pseudonymization layer could make ZDR a per-request fallback instead of a
  global provider restriction; secrets stay deterministic and fail-closed. This
  is not deployed and does not loosen the current claim in
  `docs/architecture/SECURITY.md`. Falsifier: a bounded prototype measures
  recall/false negatives on representative Italian+English personal-agent text,
  placeholder stability and request-quality impact; if it does not give a
  sufficiently safe boundary, ZDR or local-only routing for sensitive requests
  stays.
- **Do not promote before DAY-1**: full Docker productization, a generic Python
  plugin framework, a microservice/Node mesh, automatic Node distribution, an
  all-model privacy router, a full onboarding redesign, a capability-discovery
  overhaul.

### First Mac capability Node

Default placement: **MVP / trusted alpha**.

Promote to DAY-1 only if the chosen dogfood deployment requires a remote Home (for example a VPS) **and** normal daily use requires Mac-local capability during those fourteen days.

Minimum useful Node, not a general distributed platform:

```text
stable Node identity + pairing
presence / reconnect
capability advertisement
request identity / idempotency
Home authorization ∩ Node local ceiling ∩ OS permission
ExecutionPlan-bound local approval
ACK / started / outcome separation
```

Candidate first capabilities come from actual use: contained `system.run`, a narrow filesystem scope, notification, local inference or another concrete Mac-local need.

**Open design question, found 2026-09-03, not yet decided.** ADR-0050 §3
already separates Node from Surface on paper. The runtime does not yet keep
them separate: the supervised gateway pins `WorkingDirectory=${home}`
(`core/gateway/unit.ts:278`, and the plist equivalent at line 376),
`cli/gateway.ts:602` calls `buildRuntime(home)` with no `cwd`, and
`agent/runtime.ts:231` defaults `cwd` to `process.cwd()` — so on the
supervised surface `scope.root` and the shell tool's `writeScope`
(`agent/tools/shell.ts:148`) are always the Muffin home, never a repository
checkout elsewhere on the same machine. A REPL started inside that checkout
works, because there `cwd` already is the checkout. The same request from the
owner succeeds or fails depending on which surface it arrived through, and
Muffin cannot tell the difference itself. Full trace in
`docs/evidence/il-lavoro-che-viene-2026-09-03.md`.

The owner's answer names the direction without deciding it yet: **capability
must not depend on the surface, but on where Muffin lives — the node.**
«anche se sta in una vps, e io scrivo da telegram, e il nodo del macbook sta
acceso, deve poter lavorare su quei file». Today's repository conflates two
different meanings of "surface": where a message arrives, and where work
executes. Separating them is this section's Node, made concrete — and it
reopens a security question in the same breath, not after: a forwarded
message at taint 2 arriving on Telegram would, under that separation, be able
to reach a laptop's filesystem. The boundary has to be designed before the
capability — the owner said so himself: «ovviamente tutto questo va gestito
bene e specialmente in modo sicuro, quindi approcciamo tutte queste cose con
il nostro modo di lavorare» — a `docs/development/RESEARCH.md` pass and an ADR, not a
patch to this section.

This touches two existing ADRs without contradicting either: **ADR-0021** has
already had to amend itself once (§revisione 2026-09-03) for conflating a
delivery channel with conversation identity — the same class of mistake is
the risk here, on the execution axis instead of the conversation axis.
**ADR-0056** ties `sessionKey` to `identify()` regardless of port, which is a
claim about conversation identity, not about where a capability executes; a
future Node ADR must keep the two claims distinct rather than collapsing them.

**Sequencing: this cannot start before the sandbox write scope already in
flight lands** (observed Git/PR state owns whether that work is open right
now, not this file). A shell command in a turn can today write `muffin.db`,
`sessions/`, `.rot-anchor` and `voice.md`, because none of the four sit under
the paths `core/rot/guards.ts`
denies (`rot/`, `config.json`, the two secret directories, `.git/hooks`,
shell dotfiles) and `scope.root` is the whole Home. Widening *where* work can
run while the write scope is already this loose would widen the blast radius
before the boundary is narrowed — narrow the scope first.

### The two uncovered sinks, after the corpus measured them (2026-09-04)

**This is not a deferral — it is `critical-path.md` point 4-bis**, recorded here
only because the roadmap is where an authority change is looked for. The
ordering authority is the critical path; do not duplicate it.

**Status (2026-09-04, ADR-0069):** the reply sink half is closed — a
resource-name floor (`core/tracing/redact.ts`) plus a choke point on
`agent/loop.ts`'s finished text moves the corpus from 4/7→3/7 without a
human, 6/7→5/7 with the owner's real answering behaviour, `s6` fermato. The
memory sink half is not: the corpus's own attack lives inside a resource the
owner did name, so a name-based floor has nothing to catch, and a broader
"any tainted echo" floor was rejected for breaking the ordinary "read this
file back to me" request. `s7` stays open with a reason on record, not a
silent residual — see ADR-0069 §«Cosa non copre».

Point 4 of the critical path — the security eval — has run on the real binary
and produced a result rather than an opinion
(`docs/evidence/eval-taint-corpus-avversariale-2026-09-03.md`): **4/7 attacks
succeed with no human at all, 6/7 with the owner's real answering behaviour**,
and three of the seven scenes meet **no control whatsoever** — `s3` (approval
reflex), `s6` (the reply sink), `s7` (memory and recall). The single attack that
was stopped, `s4`, was stopped by the tool's own SSRF floor, not by the policy.

Those three are `allow/allow/allow` in `ROW_FLOOR` **by decision**: replying on
the origin channel and writing to memory are how the agent works. So the corpus
did not find a bug; it put a number on the cost of a recorded choice. That is
what makes this a roadmap entry instead of a defect ticket.

Two things this work is explicitly **not**. It is not "add an approval to
`reply`": 32 of 35 approvals were granted, all in one cell, and a gate granted
nine times in ten is a reflex rather than a defence — the failure the threat
model names first. And it is not "replace ambient taint with candidate B": that
substitution was measured and lost, beating A on **0/7** contested actions and
tightening only `s4`, where the attack never succeeded anyway. Reopening either
needs new evidence, not a fresh preference.

What it is: the owner's house rule — *keep deterministic what needs to be
deterministic, do not lean on an LLM where code can decide* — applied where the
corpus says it is missing. `s4` is the existence proof: a floor in code stopped
it, asking nobody and trusting no judgement. Needs a `docs/development/RESEARCH.md` pass
before implementation, because it changes authority semantics on two rows.

Note the ordering trap: the disk fence merged on 2026-09-04 is a **prerequisite**
of this work and not a part of it. It supplies provenance — it makes "external
content arrives marked as external" a true sentence — and stops there. Whether
the model then obeys the mark is what the corpus measures, and on these three
scenes it does not. A defence resting on obedience is not this item.

### Five items from the owner's conversation, 2026-09-03

Recorded in `docs/evidence/il-lavoro-che-viene-2026-09-03.md`. All five queue
behind what is already in flight — the sandbox write scope above, the
derived architecture map's rebase conflicts, and the character eval
(`requirements-status.md` A2/A3, `evals/character/`, never yet on a path in
`docs/status/day1/critical-path.md`) — because none of the five change what
closes the dogfood in progress. Ordered below by what unblocks what, not by
which feels most wanted; no effort estimate is claimed for any of them.

#### A maintenance tick, not a heartbeat conversation

First, because in the owner's own words a capability nobody ever re-checks
does not exist for him — the other four assume a Muffin that is still there
to use them. Measured today on the owner's live database: `todos` holds seven
rows still `pending` from 2026-08-27, a plan written and never surfaced
again. `B4` (READY) reads the plan on every turn of a session; nothing today
starts a turn on its own to do that reading when no one has written to the
session.

This is not `COGNITIVE-DESIGN.md` §5's rejected "proactivity as regular
heartbeat conversation" — elapsed time is still not a reason to interrupt the
owner. The gap is narrower: whether the runtime's own scheduler tick
re-checks durable `pending`/`waiting` state (todos, `interrupted` turns, due
jobs) at all when nothing is due, so it does not rot silently, independent of
whether anything is ever surfaced to the owner. Adjacent to, not the same as,
"Background process ownership" and "Proactivity beyond explicit jobs" below —
those are about owning a long-lived process and about initiating dialogue;
this is about the runtime's own liveness cadence over its own durable state.
Record repeats of this pain the same way as any other dogfood signal
(`docs/status/day1/critical-path.md` "Da qui ordina l'uso" already asks for
"lavoro promesso e dimenticato").

#### GitHub delivery: plan, implement, test, commit, PR

Second, because it is the cheapest large step and the item after it depends
on the same egress door. What is missing for coding is delivery, not
authorship: Muffin can already write code, run tests and commit locally.
Missing is push/PR — no network egress exists today (`defaults/rot/egress.json`
ships an empty allow list) — and, secondarily, parallelism through subagents,
which the runtime has no mechanism for yet either. The candidate shape is a
coding skill in the existing sense (`defaults/skills/`, D9 — plan → implement
→ test → commit → PR) plus `github.com` added through the existing
capability-setup widen-and-reseal flow (ADR-0058,
`widenEgressForCapability`), not a new mechanism.

#### Issues are plans; without read-back Muffin is a blind planner

Third, because it opens the same egress door as the item above, for reading
instead of writing, and has no reason to land before it. Muffin's own
framing: writing a GitHub issue is a plan, not code, and reversible — it fits
inside a revocable boundary. But without reading back the resulting pull
request, comments and reviews, Muffin is a blind planner: it writes, the plan
vanishes, and it never learns whether the work was done well. The item is
"write issues **and** read back their consequences," never just the first
half — the read-back needs the same `github.com` door the section above
would open for writing.

#### Per-task egress boundaries, not one flat allowlist

Fourth: no stated dependency on the other four, and generalizing egress ahead
of the item above would be answering a question dogfood has not asked yet.
Today `rot/egress.json` is a single sealed allow-only list — in or out, with
no perimeter scoped to a task. This is the technical form of the owner's own
boundary: «se giri nel perimetro hai governance e quindi puoi fare cose più
liberamente». It changes authority/egress semantics, so it needs a
`docs/development/RESEARCH.md` pass before any implementation, not a direct patch to
`core/rot/egress-writer.ts`. It is a different axis from ADR-0050's Node
ceiling: that intersection (`Home ∩ Node ∩ OS`) narrows what a *paired
device* may do; this would narrow what a *single task/turn* may reach on the
same Home. Read the two together when the research pass happens — do not
conflate them into one mechanism by default.

#### New senses: calendar, email, half-finished projects

Last: purely additive, nothing else in this list unblocks or is unblocked by
it. Today Muffin senses the vault and messages. Not the calendar, not email,
not half-finished projects. Candidate capabilities follow the same rules
already governing every other source: consumer-before-schema (ADR-0045) and
the typed multipart ingress model (ADR-0052) for whatever a new source
parses into.

### Intentional memory proposals

ADR-0051 owns the architecture: many producers, one semantic writer.

When the product needs explicit `remember` / agent-intentional memory, implement a durable proposal path into canonical reconciliation rather than direct writes to active Beliefs.

This can be promoted into DAY-1 if reconciliation of the DAY-1 requirements shows that inability to intentionally remember a fact would force a fallback during the dogfood window.

**Evidence (2026-09-07):** the proposal path of ADR-0051 is not implemented, and the memory loop (write → reconcile → use → correct → forget) is open at several points; measurement and peer comparison in `docs/evidence/critica-moduli-vs-peer-2026-09-07.md`. Conclusion for placement: close that loop before adding ontology, starting from a retrieval-quality measure that can get worse. The promotion trigger above is unchanged.

### Home migration / Capsule v0

Before trusted users accumulate continuity that is painful to lose, provide a verified way to move/restore one Home while preserving canonical state and rebuilding derived state.

This is distinct from active-active replication.

### Consumer control plane

A desktop/consumer UI may expose Home health, Nodes, provider/model, work, approvals, budget, backup/update and capability status. It is a control surface for the same Muffin, never a second agent.

It should also make **data placement** legible rather than forcing the owner to infer it from config: which model provider receives assembled context, whether embeddings are local or remote, which network destinations a capability may reach, and which execution paths are locally sandboxed. This is visibility over existing boundaries, not a promise of automatic privacy routing.

### Capability discovery / deferred tool loading

Default placement: **MVP / trusted alpha, only after measured catalogue pressure**.

If dogfood shows that useful capabilities are being hidden by a static exposure cap, or tool choice degrades as the catalogue grows, replace repeated cap increases with a two-stage shape:

```text
small always-visible primitive set
        ↓
capability/tool discovery
        ↓
load the relevant definition when needed
```

The point is not token optimization by itself. It is to let capability breadth grow without forcing every model to choose among the whole catalogue on every turn. Preserve the same policy kernel: discovery changes what the model can see, not what it is authorised to execute.

Do not build this merely because external agent SDKs support tool search/deferred loading. The trigger is Muffin-specific evidence.

**Trigger observed (2026-09-07).** The static exposure cap has been raised three times on the owner's installation to stop cutting base tools (evidence: `docs/evidence/personal-agent-ecosystem-audit-2026-09-07.md` §6 and the `consumer-local` profile notes). This is the catalogue pressure the entry asked for, so the item is a candidate claim; it is not an authorization to implement. The D13 re-measurement with the read-only shell comes first, and the shape must be chosen against the character eval. **#469 owns the observed problem** (keep needed authorized tools reachable beyond the profile cap); this section owns the phase placement.

**Owner direction recorded 2026-09-13 (planned; semantics not yet researched).**
Slash-command discovery and capability discovery should improve together. The
owner should be able to ask Muffin for maintenance work, such as updating
Muffin, from Telegram and continue it through an explicit durable pending or
approval state. A future search/discovery tool is a way to find and load a
capability, never an authorization grant: execution still uses the same
principal, capability and policy checks on every surface. Any unavoidable HITL
step, such as approving a restart, must be explicit in the capability contract
and interaction rather than hidden in a surface-specific hardcode. Before
implementation, a `docs/development/RESEARCH.md` pass must challenge the discovery shape and
settle pending-turn identity, update/restart/rollback, idempotency and approval
resumption. This adds an owner-stated candidate requirement to this
MVP/trusted-alpha item; it does not change DAY-1 scope or choose an
implementation.

### Consumer-gated generalization (deferred, from #669)

Generalizations with no second real consumer stay deferred; they are recorded
here so the map that captured them can be archived without losing the placement.

- **Model-provider catalog**: `ProviderId` names one product provider and
  provider-specific behaviour should live at the adapter edge behind the stable
  inference contract. Do not build a provider registry/plugin seam until a
  second real provider needs it (#498 owns reasoning normalization; native
  Anthropic features are KEEP).
- **Search-provider catalog**: same reasoning; Tavily stays the
  default/recommended provider (#521 is the browser-OAuth/remote-MCP consumer
  candidate).
- **Observability exporter**: local redacted traces stay; a general OTLP
  exporter is added only for a concrete operator/hosting need, never by default
  and never by exporting secrets.

### Persistent specialist facets and steerable workers

Default placement: **MVP / trusted alpha, hypothesis only** (evidence: `docs/evidence/personal-agent-ecosystem-audit-2026-09-07.md` §8-9). One canonical Muffin identity may carry persistent specialist facets that are neither replaceable workers nor separate Muffins; delegated work may need a small control surface (spawn, status, steer, stop, resume) rather than spawn-only delegation. Muffin has no subagents today, by choice (ADR-0045). Trigger: an observed dogfood need that a single context cannot serve, or a delegated task the owner could not steer without losing work. Nothing here authorizes a multi-agent society.

### Local / owner-controlled compute experiments

Evaluate local models, transcription, embeddings and other compute against Muffin-specific tasks before building an automatic router.

Placement may be Home-local, Node-local, dedicated owner-controlled compute or remote provider. Automatic scheduling/routing is earned by measured benefit.

### Overflow / context-pressure UX

Revisit together rather than as unrelated polish:

- large tool output → durable file/vault object + compact handle instead of destructive placeholder-only compaction;
- visible context-pressure signal if real sessions show it changes behaviour usefully;
- structured long-running progress if placeholder/streaming proves insufficient.

Current DAY-1 lineage: requirements B12, B13, C9. Dogfood decides which of these are product needs versus unnecessary machinery.

### Proactivity beyond explicit jobs

ADR-0028's high-confidence posture remains the constraint. Revisit concrete detectors only after real memory/work data exists and usefulness/noise can be measured.

Do not reintroduce a generic “I noticed…” firehose.

**Groups (placed here 2026-09-04, owner decision: *«deterministico + proattivo,
la versione completa dopo»*).** DAY-1 ships the deterministic base only — a
group turn opens when Muffin is addressed (ADR-0063, DAY-1 row F1). The
proactive half is this phase: a debounce on T seconds of silence, an
X-message threshold in busy moments, embedding relevance against what the
room's tenant already knows, a light model only on the survivors, a per-room
switch, and a throttle under Telegram's 20 messages/minute per group. It is
measured before it is widened, because the failure mode it risks is the one
§8 of the thesis names first: something the owner learns to ignore.

### Background process ownership

Starting/owning long-lived background processes beyond current wait/process inspection remains consumer-triggered. Add it when a real daily workflow requires Muffin to own such a process lifecycle.

## Product public alpha

These matter before broad public use if the corresponding surface/extension is shipped.
Source-public/pre-alpha is the earlier, separate milestone — inspectable and
contributable when publication is safe, without the product guarantees below.

### Stable lifecycle across supported Home platforms

- install/update/rollback with schema migration safety;
- hot backup/restore and canonical export/import sufficient for accumulated continuity;
- supported Home/Node platform matrix;
- diagnostics that distinguish Home, Surface, Node, Worker and provider failures.

### Node security and lifecycle, if Nodes ship publicly

- pairing/revocation documented and tested;
- local-ceiling permission UX;
- protocol authentication/replay protection;
- capability/authority diff on updates;
- reconnect and failure semantics visible to owner and `sys.inspect`.

### Extension containment and authority

`package != capability != grant` remains the architecture.

Before community/third-party code is presented as meaningfully isolated, add the containment boundary justified by its authority and lifecycle. A manifest is not a sandbox and locally executed third-party code remains part of the TCB until a real boundary exists.

### MCP hot lifecycle

Hot revocation/removal may be promoted here if MCP is a supported public extension path. DAY-1 currently accepts restart-based removal because the supervisor makes restart an explicit lifecycle operation.

### Discord completion

If Discord is a public supported Surface, finish any currently deferred parity such as resumed-turn delivery and run the same ingress/identity/provenance guarantees expected of supported surfaces.

### General ingress contract

After more than the initial Telegram consumer exists, generalize only the semantics proven common: typed parts, provenance, authenticated principal, transport idempotency and surface-owned composition. Do not create a universal field catalog before consumers exist.

## Post-MVP product and hardware

### Core Deep Research (deferred direction, from #595)

A **core, surface-agnostic Muffin capability** — `Research(request,
KnowledgeScope)` — is a post-MVP product direction, not an MVP requirement. It
is not owned by Telegram, Community or any connector; an implementation whose
research semantics branch on the surface is wrong by construction.

Canonical method:

```text
research request → resolve KnowledgeScope → search owned scoped knowledge first
→ inspect previous ResearchRuns / Vault sources / relevant Memory
→ evaluate coverage + temporal freshness
→ REUSE | TARGETED VERIFY | DELTA REFRESH | FULL EXTERNAL RESEARCH
→ collect source evidence → synthesize claims → verify citations
→ persist a versioned report in the Vault
→ expose a concise result + the durable report through the current surface
```

- **Freshness is a model, not one TTL**: FRESH (reuse), LIKELY_FRESH (bounded
  targeted verification), NEEDS_REFRESH (delta research, new version linked to
  the previous one), STALE/current-request (fresh external research).
- **Durability**: a research result is not chat text. The full report belongs in
  the Vault as versioned durable content; Memory may know it exists, it must not
  replace the source/report store. Original papers/documents remain canonical
  evidence; parses/chunks/embeddings/summaries are derived and rebuildable.
- **Knowledge scopes** must work without Community existing: owner-private is
  first-class; a standalone group scope if policy permits; community scope
  later. No automatic owner-personal → Community leakage.
- **Delivery is separate from research semantics**: a long report is not pasted
  as chat spam; progress is a Work/surface projection.
- **It grants no special authority** because it is called research.

Prerequisites before any implementation: continuation/runtime durability,
context provenance/attention, KnowledgeScope/Vault semantics, capability
discovery as catalogs grow, and post-context authority/taint review for
non-owner egress.

Falsifiers: web-first reflex without checking owned knowledge; reports stored
only in chat history; separate private/group/community research engines; one
arbitrary freshness TTL; in-place rewriting with no version; summaries treated
as equivalent to source evidence; research conflated with personal Memory;
community access to owner-private knowledge by default; a generic workflow
framework added before these needs require it.

### Pendant

The pendant is a specialized **Node + Surface** of the same Muffin.

Prototype after voice and the Node contract have real consumers:

```text
Node capabilities:
  audio.capture
  optional speaker
  haptic/status

Surface semantics:
  push-to-talk / wake
  interrupt / steer
  voice reply
```

The experiment succeeds only if this body materially reduces the need to open a conventional interface enough to justify battery/network/hardware cost.

### Ambient speaker / Watch / phone-native body

Use the same Node + Surface grammar. No device-specific memory or second policy/agent.

### Richer media

Video ingestion, full visual-document understanding/OCR pipelines and richer rendering are post-DAY-1 capability work unless dogfood proves a narrower subset is necessary earlier.

Original media remains Evidence; transcripts/OCR/captions are derived representations with provenance.

## Research only / consumer-triggered

These are deliberately **not roadmap commitments**. A measured failure mode or new product requirement must promote them first.

### Replicated continuity / multi-Home

- active-active Home;
- automatic leader election;
- CRDT/conflict-free continuity merge;
- Nodes autonomously taking canonical authority when Home is unreachable;
- complete canonical memory replicas on Nodes.

Current rule: one authoritative Home. Home outage may make Muffin unavailable; a Node does not silently become leader.

### Degraded offline local Muffin

A Node that continues limited local cognition while disconnected could eventually be useful, but reconciling its work/effects/memory with the Home is distributed-systems complexity. Research only until outages make it a concrete product problem.

### Generic distributed compute scheduler

No service mesh, broker, cluster scheduler or resource optimizer merely because Nodes make them imaginable. Add only when explicit placement is measurably insufficient.

### World-state schema

World state is conceptually distinct from Evidence, Beliefs and Work, but no generic world-state table is created before a consumer proves which state must be represented. ADR-0045's consumer-before-schema rule remains in force.

### Hosted multi-tenant Muffin

A centrally hosted multi-tenant product has a different trust/data/operations model. It is not treated as an incremental deployment mode of the owner-run architecture.

## How an item moves

An item may change phase only with a reason:

```text
observed dogfood pain
new supported-surface requirement
security finding
measured performance/cost pressure
new public compatibility promise
new hardware/product experiment
or explicit owner decision
```

When an item becomes DAY-1 relevant, add/reclassify it in the DAY-1 requirements. When it becomes active work, observed Git/GitHub own execution state. When its semantic shape changes, update Architecture/Security or write/supersede an ADR.

This file never says that something is implemented merely because its phase has arrived.
