/**
 * The mandatory deny paths, in one place, because the threat model names five
 * and the runtime was enforcing three.
 *
 * 03 §3-bis: *"**Mandatory deny paths**: `~/.muffin/rot/`, config, secrets,
 * `.git/hooks`, dotfile di shell — negati in scrittura SEMPRE, anche dentro un
 * allow-write ampio (anti config-tampering; complementa i permessi OS del
 * RoT)."* Five categories. `agent/runtime.ts` had `[p.rot, p.secrets,
 * p.config]` — written out twice, once for the filesystem tools and once for
 * the sandbox — and the last two categories were in no list at all.
 *
 * The two that were missing are the two that survive a reinstall of everything
 * else. A write to `.git/hooks/pre-commit` executes on the owner's next commit,
 * outside the sandbox, as the owner, with no capability check anywhere in the
 * path — the containment is escaped by leaving a note for a process that is not
 * contained. A line appended to `~/.zshrc` does the same on the next shell.
 * Neither needs a privilege the agent does not already have: `fs.write` is
 * medium risk, and the working directory is a git repo whose `.git` is inside
 * `root` (ADR-0030 requires exactly that).
 *
 * They live here rather than inline at the two call sites for the reason the
 * old comment at the second site already gave: *"two deny-lists that drift are
 * one deny-list plus a hole"*. That was true, and the answer to it is one
 * function, not two literals that happen to match today.

      //
      //    The threat model's five are the five *escapes* that were known when
      //    it was written; they are not a description of what the home holds.
      //    Measured on the production `SandboxExecutor` with this very list
      //    (2026-09-03): `rot/` and `config.json` held, and `.rot-anchor`,
      //    `muffin.db`, `voice.md` and `sessions/` were all overwritten by an
      //    ordinary `shell_run` — because in the supervised gateway the write
      //    scope *was* the home (`core/config/workspace.ts` documents how it
      //    got to be). `.rot-anchor` lives beside `rot/`, not inside it — "an
      //    anchor inside what it anchors is decoration" (`core/rot/verify.ts`)
      //    — so the entry protecting the sealed directory did not protect the
      //    seal, and a write there costs the next boot an `anchor_mismatch`.
      //
      //    Naming the home is the only spelling of "Muffin's own state" that a
      //    file added next month is inside by default. The five below stay:
      //    three are subsumed by this line, two are not (`.git/hooks` and the
      //    dotfiles live outside the home), and a list that says which threats
      //    it answers is worth more than a shorter one.
      //
      //    This is the belt. The braces are that a turn no longer works *in*
      //    the home at all (`resolveWorkspace`); either alone would close the
      //    measured hole, and neither alone survives the next surface that
      //    forgets to pass a workspace.

      // entries long — so it protected the secrets Muffin knows it has and
      // nothing about the ones the host has.
      //
      // That was half an exfiltration waiting for its other half. `shell_run`
      // could already read these bytes and its stdout reaches the model; what
      // was missing was an exit. The GitHub-delivery research
