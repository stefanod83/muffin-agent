/**
 * The Muffin home is not a workspace, proven the only way it is worth proving:
 * a real command, through the production `SandboxExecutor`, with the real
 * `mandatoryGuards` — never a mock of either.
 *
 * ## What was measured before the fix
 *
 * The supervised gateway ran with `cwd = ~/.muffin` (its unit pins
 * `WorkingDirectory` there on purpose, ADR-0035), `cli/gateway.ts` built the
 * runtime with no cwd, and that cwd became `FsScope.root` **and** the
 * sandbox's `writeScope`. Against that configuration, on this file's own
 * scaffold (2026-09-03, seatbelt):
 *
 * ```text
 * denied   rot/egress.json    exit=1  Operation not permitted
 * WRITTEN  .rot-anchor        exit=0  20B → 6B
 * WRITTEN  muffin.db          exit=0  20480B → 6B
 * WRITTEN  voice.md           exit=0  17B → 6B
 * WRITTEN  sessions/*.jsonl   exit=0  14B → 6B
 * ```
 *
 * `.rot-anchor` is the sharp one: it lives *beside* `rot/`, so the deny that
 * covered the sealed directory did not cover the seal, and a write there makes
 * the next `verify()` answer `anchor_mismatch` — safe mode in single-user, a
 * refused boot when hardened. `muffin.db` holds episodes, chunks, facts, turns,
 * jobs and spend; `sessions/` holds the conversation history. Every one of
 * those is reachable from a turn whose content arrived in a forwarded message,
 * a web page or a PDF.
 *
 * ## What this file falsifies, and what it does not
 *
 * The fix has two halves:
 *
 * - **the braces** — `resolveWorkspace` (`core/config/workspace.ts`) never
 *   hands a turn the installation, so the write scope is a sibling directory;
 * - **the belt** — `mandatoryGuards` denies the home outright, so even a write
 *   scope that *named* the home would not reach it.
 *
 * **Only the belt is falsifiable here, and an earlier version of this comment
 * claimed otherwise.** It said the first block "reverts red when the braces
 * go". It does not: that block builds a home and a workspace by hand and never
 * calls `resolveWorkspace` at all, so removing the braces leaves all of its
 * assertions green — measured by a judge, 2026-09-03, not reasoned about. The
 * sentence was false, and a test file that misstates where its own guarantee
 * lives is worse than one that says nothing, because the next reader trusts
 * it.
 *
 * So, precisely:
 *
 * - **the belt** is falsified *here*: with `p.home` removed from
 *   `core/rot/guards.ts`, the second block fails on `.rot-anchor`,
 *   `muffin.db`, `voice.md`, the grandchild and the interpreter, while the
 *   first stays green;
 * - **the braces** are falsified *elsewhere*, and both places are needed:
 *   `core/config/workspace.test.ts` for the decision itself, and
 *   `evals/system/acceptance.test.ts` — *"a turn's own writes land in
 *   runtime.workspace"* — for the wiring at the production seam. That second
 *   one exists because reverting `FsScope.root`/`makeShellTool` to the raw
 *   `cwd`, with `resolveWorkspace` left intact, once left the entire suite
 *   green: a deny cannot hold the wiring, since a deny looks the same
 *   whichever mechanism produced it. Only a positive claim can.
 *
 * What this file proves, then, is the belt — and it proves it against a real
 * containment rather than a mock.
 *
 * ## The two properties a deny list gets wrong more often than the deny
 *
 * - it is **inherited**: a shell that spawns a shell, a freshly spawned
 *   interpreter and a command under a pty are contained by the same
 *   kernel-level boundary — a deny that only held for the first process would
 *   be a deny an `sh -c` walks around;
 * - it is **not a wall**: each block has a control leg that must succeed.
 *   Without one, a sandbox that had stopped working entirely would read as a
 *   perfect green — the ambiguity `probe.ts` and `executor.ts` both have their
 *   own two-legged shape for.
 *
 * Every target below is written by exactly one test. An earlier test's
 * successful attack must never be able to leave a later one comparing `pwned`
 * to `pwned` and calling it a pass — which is what the first draft of this file
 * did, caught by the mutation run rather than by reading it.
