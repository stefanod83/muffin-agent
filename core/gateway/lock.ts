/**
 * Who owns the scheduler.
 *
 * ADR-0035 moves the ticker out of the REPL and into a process that lives. The
 * moment that is true there are two things that *could* tick, and two tickers
 * on one job store means a job runs twice — the shape of Hermes #25517 that
 * ADR-0022's corollary told us to design out rather than discover.
 *
 * So the gateway takes a durable claim, and the REPL reads it. The mechanism is
 * the send lock's, generalised into `core/lock/durable.ts` instead of copied
 * (see that file for the argument, and sendlock.ts for why the claim has this
 * shape at all). One thing had to change, and it is the interesting one:
 *
 * **The horizon is a heartbeat, not a duration.** A proactive send is a single
 * model call, so the send lock can say "older than an hour means gone". A
 * gateway holds its lock for weeks; silence proves nothing about it. Instead it
 * refreshes `taken_at` on every tick, and a claim that has missed ten beats is
 * stale. That keeps both halves: a live gateway is never taken over, and one
 * that was `kill -9`d never wedges `muffin` — which is the requirement the send
 * lock's own docstring pins down and which a bare pid check cannot meet,
 * because pids are reused: in a restarted container, at once. Whether the
 * holder is alive is asked of its incarnation, not its pid (ADR-0092).
 *
 * Two extra columns beyond the claim, because "visibile e ammazzabile" is
 * constraint 5 of the ADR and needs data: `since` (when this holder started,
 * which is uptime and must not move on a beat) and `status` (what it is doing,
 * for `muffin gateway status` and `doctor`).
