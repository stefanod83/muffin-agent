/**
 * One proactive send at a time.
 *
 * The hole it closes: `observe()` reads `fires.has(anchor)`, the caller records
 * the fire after delivery, and nothing spans the two — so two runs started
 * together both see an unfired anchor and both deliver. Measured before this
 * existed: two messages, one row, exit 0 twice. `INSERT OR IGNORE` protects the
 * row, not the owner, and a duplicate nudge is exactly the repetition the
 * observing spine exists to prevent.
 *
 * ## Why a table and not a lock file
 *
 * The first attempt was `open(..., 'wx')` plus a pid file, and it was wrong in a
 * way worth keeping written down, because it is the ordinary way to write this.
 * An O_EXCL create is atomic, but *stealing a stale lock is not*: a run reads a
 * dead pid, then unlinks — and by then the file may be someone else's live lock.
 * Two processes measured it 6 times out of 6, both holding the lock, both
 * delivering.
 *
 * `rename` instead of `unlink` fixes the wrong half. It makes the steal have a
 * single winner, but the winner still renames away a path, not the inode it
 * judged dead — same 6/6. Verifying what you took (read it back, put it back if
 * it is not the pid you condemned) narrows it to a three-process window, where
 * the restore can land on top of a lock created while you looked.
 *
 * `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` has none of it: SQLite admits one writer, so read-then-claim
 * cannot interleave with another read-then-claim. There is nothing to steal and
 * nothing to put back, and the database was already open two lines away. The
 * shape of the bug — check, then act on what you checked — is the same one the
 * lock was written to fix, which is why it kept reappearing until the check and
 * the act stopped being two steps.
 *
 * ## What it still does not cover
 *
 * Nothing outside this database: another process writing the fire log directly
 * is not serialised by anything here.
 *
 * And one guarantee this file depends on without owning: a run that loses the
 * race must **wait** for the writer ahead of it rather than throwing
 * SQLITE_BUSY out of `acquire`. That comes from better-sqlite3, which sets
 * `busy_timeout = 5000` on every connection unless a caller passes `timeout: 0`
 * (measured, both ways). Setting the pragma here again was written and removed:
 * it changed nothing, and the test asserting it was asserting the driver.
 * `sendlock.test.ts` guards the inherited default instead, which is the thing
 * that could actually stop being true.
 *
 * Liveness is asked of the holder's incarnation since ADR-0092, and of its pid
 * for a claim written without one. A bare pid is weaker than it looks: it takes
 * ordinary reuse after a hard kill, not a 2³² wrap, for a dead holder to read as
 * alive, and in a restarted container that reuse is immediate. Left there it
 * would wedge the command while telling the owner to wait for a send that ended
 * long ago. So `taken_at` is the backstop: a lock older than an hour is stale
 * whatever its holder looks like. A proactive send is one model call, so an hour is
 * generous by two orders of magnitude, and it collapses the whole liveness
 * question into a clause the row already has the data for.
 *
 * ## Where the mechanism now lives
 *
 * The claim itself moved to `core/lock/durable.ts` when the gateway needed the
 * same three properties (ADR-0035). This file keeps its table, its horizon and
 * its wording; the transaction is shared. The schema below is unchanged and
 * deliberately so — every installed home already has this table, and
 * `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` does not migrate.
 */

/**
