/**
 * Every proactive gate evaluation, durably, with its discriminated reason.
 *
 * `FireLog` (`firelog.ts`) answers "already spoken, don't repeat" — it records
 * allows that reached the owner (and permanent tainted denies), and deliberately
 * never records defers. This table answers a different question: "what did the
 * gate decide, when, and why" — including defers and skips, which are exactly
 * the silences the old Muffin could never interrogate ("why did you stay
 * quiet?"). The two tables must not be merged: one is dedup state that shapes
 * future behaviour, the other is history that explains past behaviour.
 *
 * Rows are never deleted (invariant §I-8) and never re-decided: a `defer` row
 * does not silence anything, it only remembers that at this time the gate said
 * "not now". The next pass decides again and writes its own row — unless the
 * decision is identical to the anchor's latest, in which case the write is
 * skipped. That transition rule is what keeps a 30-second tick from writing
 * 2 880 identical rows a day while still showing every change of mind.
 *
 * Falsifier for the whole table (DT-10): if nothing reads these rows in 30
 * days, delete this module — an unread log is ceremony, not proprioception.
