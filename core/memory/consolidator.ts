/**
 * What makes consolidation start by itself.
 *
 * `ingestPending` turns episodes into facts and has been correct since
 * `6ddba7c`. Until this file it had exactly one caller — `muffin memory
 * extract`, typed by hand — so on a real install facts stayed at **0** against
 * the old system's 414, and, because nothing else embeds an episode, recall
 * stayed keyword-only for the life of the install. ADR-0038 is the decision
 * record; this is the mechanism.
 *
 * ## The trigger: trailing edge of the conversation, with a count as the net
 *
 * The old system extracted on **every** turn and `memory_saved` fired on 78 of
 * 2 264 items — a **3.4%** yield, one model call per turn for one fact per
 * thirty. So the trigger has to be finer than "a turn arrived". Four
 * independent systems converged on the same finer thing (LangMem, Memobase,
 * Honcho, Supermemory — all trailing-edge idle debounce, none on a pure cron),
 * and this follows them with one difference that matters: their debounces are
 * tuned for *"the session is over"* (15-60 minutes), and the bar here is
 * stricter. The old pipeline's end-to-end median was **11.8 s**, not "minutes",
 * which means the fact was in place **before the next message of the same
 * conversation**. That property is the product; a mechanism that lands at
 * minutes would be a regression, not an approximation.
 *
 * A debounce alone has one failure: a conversation that never pauses never
 * consolidates. Hence the ceiling — the "N episodi non consolidati" the M5 DoD
 * asked for, kept as the **backstop** rather than the primary trigger, which is
 * the role the external evidence supports.
 *
 * ## Why this is not a `JobStore` job and not a `Scheduler` lane
 *
 * A `Job` carries a natural-language `goal` and is executed by `runTurn` with
 * the main model, the tool set and the kernel. Consolidation is none of those:
 * it is `ingestPending` on the light lane, with no tools and no capability for
 * `decide()` to rule on. Expressing it as a job would mean writing a sentence in
 * Italian and hoping the model calls a tool that does not exist.
 *
 * And `Scheduler` is deliberately a **single lane** — "one owner, one model
 * lane, one job at a time". Putting consolidation in it makes the 8am brief and
 * the memory lane compete: a brief in flight would defer consolidation past its
 * trailing edge, and a 20-episode backlog would delay the brief. Worse, the two
 * want *opposite* arbitration — a job yields to the owner (ADR-0022's
 * foreground gate), whereas consolidation is supposed to run precisely when the
 * owner has just stopped. Two mechanisms, because they are two mechanisms.
 *
 * ## Where it lives
 *
 * Built by `buildRuntime`, so **every process that runs turns has one**: the
 * gateway (which hosts the remote surfaces) and a REPL window alike. Making it
 * the gateway's alone would leave an owner without an installed unit exactly
 * where they are today — facts at zero. Two processes cannot double-extract:
 * `ingestPending` takes the durable lane lock (`ingest-lock.ts`) and a loser is
 * refused, not queued.
 */

/**
 * The trailing edge: how long the conversation must be quiet before the lane
 * runs.
 *
 * **20 s, measured on the owner's own corpus** (`~/dev/Muffin/muffin.dev.db`,
 * 4 107 episodes, 2026-03-16 → 2026-07-18) rather than picked. Three numbers
 * decided it, each from a different direction:
 *
 *  - **It does not fire while the owner is typing.** Of 1 793 consecutive owner
 *    messages, only **1.0%** are less than 20 s apart (3.5% under 30 s, 9.6%
 *    under 45 s). One turn in a hundred pays an extra light-model call; none
 *    pays a wrong fact, because extraction is per-episode and the marker is
 *    per-episode too.
 *  - **It keeps the property the 11.8 s bar bought.** Measuring the real clock —
 *    from the reply landing to the next owner message — a 20 s trailing edge
 *    fires **1 326 times for 1 793 turns**: 26% fewer model calls than
 *    per-turn, at 1.35 turns per fire. The fact lands ~20 s plus one light call
 *    after the turn, which is still inside the gap for the large majority of
 *    pairs (median gap from reply to next message: 56 s).
 *  - **Longer buys almost nothing and costs the property.** 30 s fires 1 282
 *    times — **3.3% fewer calls for 50% more latency**. 60 s fires 1 075 times
 *    (19% fewer calls) but exceeds the 56 s median gap, so the fact would
 *    routinely land *after* the next message, which is the thing being
 *    protected. The field's 15-60 minutes answers a different question ("is the
 *    session over"), and at the owner's 272 s median inter-message gap it would
 *    coalesce a whole day into one fire.

/**
 * The backstop: consolidate after this many turns even if the quiet never

 *
 * **12, and it is chosen to be a net rather than a second trigger.** On the same
 * corpus, at exactly the 20 s trailing edge above, the longest run of turns
 * without a qualifying pause was **7** (p90 = 2, p99 = 4). Twelve sits 70% above
 * the observed maximum, so on four months of the owner's real traffic this would
 * have fired **zero times** — which is what a backstop should do — while
 * bounding the un-consolidated window at twelve turns for the deep-work session
 * the corpus happens not to contain. It is also the observed maximum at a 60 s
 * debounce, so it stays a backstop if the trailing edge is ever raised toward
 * the field's range.
 *
 * The field brackets it without settling it: Letta 5, AgentCore 6, mem0 Dream
 * 20, Honcho 50. Generative Agents used a **salience sum** (importance ≥ 150,
 * 2-3 fires/day) instead of a count — rejected here for a specific reason, in

/**
 * Episodes per fire.
 *
 * A fire is armed by a turn, so the ordinary batch is one or two episodes and

 * offline stretch leaves hundreds pending, and one trailing edge must not turn
 * into a twenty-minute run of model calls. The remainder is not lost — the next
 * fire takes the next page.
 *
 * The consequence, stated because it is real: `pendingEpisodes` is
 * `ORDER BY created_at`, so while a backlog larger than this exists, the
 * *newest* episode is not the one being consolidated and the "in place before
 * the next message" property does not hold. That is what the drain below
 * exists to end.
 */
const CONSOLIDATION_BATCH = 20;

/**
 * The drain: what happens when one page was not enough.
 *
 * ## The problem, precisely
 *
 * A backlog larger than `CONSOLIDATION_BATCH` costs the trailing edge its whole
 * point. `pendingEpisodes` is `ORDER BY created_at`, so a fire under backlog
 * spends its page on the *oldest* episodes and the message that just armed it
 * is not in the batch. The property being bought — the fact in place before the
 * next message of the same conversation — is silently not held, and nothing
 * says so. Backlogs are not hypothetical here: `muffin run` headless leaves its
 * episodes pending by design (the timer is `unref`'d), a gateway that was down
 * accumulates, and a migration starts with the whole corpus owed.
 *
 * ## The fix, and why it is not a reordering
 *
 * The obvious move is to make the live fire take the *newest* pending episodes
 * and leave the tail to maintenance. It is wrong, and quietly: `reconcile`
 * picks its supersede candidate by `recorded_at` — when we learned it — so
 * extracting out of chronological order makes an *older* episode's claim arrive
 * as the "incoming" one against a newer belief. The judge would then be asked
 * whether last month's answer replaces this week's, and a `supersede` verdict
 * would un-correct a correction. Losing an extraction is recoverable
 * (`extraction_v` exists for that); a wrong supersede is invisible until
 * somebody asks the question it answered. The asymmetry is decision #2 of the
 * research doc, and it rules the reordering out.
 *
 * So the order stays, and the backlog is removed instead: after a page that was
 * **full** and **made progress**, the lane re-arms itself and takes the next
 * page. The property is restored by convergence rather than by priority.
 *
 * ## Why it re-uses `CONSOLIDATION_IDLE_MS` instead of getting its own constant
 *
 * Two reasons, and the first is the important one. **The peak rate of the drain
 * is then the peak rate of the live lane, by construction** — one bounded page
 * per twenty seconds, which is exactly what the trailing edge already spends
 * when the owner is talking steadily. That makes "maintenance must not cost
 * more than the lane it maintains" a property of the shape rather than a number
 * to defend. Second: a new constant would need its own corpus measurement to be
 * anything but folklore, and there is nothing in the corpus that decides it —
 * the drain's pace has no user-visible deadline, only a convergence time. At
 * one page per 20 s the owner's whole four-month corpus (4 107 episodes, 206
 * pages) drains in ~69 minutes of quiet, which is well inside a single evening
 * and does not need to wait for one.
 *
 * The drain always loses to the live lane: a turn arriving mid-drain re-arms
 * the trailing edge instead, so the head of the queue is served next.
 *
 * ## The stop condition is progress, never a count
 *
 * `fetched === limit` says there is more behind this page. `marked > 0` says
 * the head of the queue actually moved. Both, or the drain stops.
 *
 * The second half is not caution. An episode whose extraction fails
 * permanently is deliberately left unmarked so it is retried, so it sits at the
 * head of `ORDER BY created_at` for ever. A drain that continued on "is
 * anything still pending" would re-read that page every twenty seconds and pay
 * for the same failing extraction until the month's budget was gone — which is
 * the *same* failure ADR-0038 rejected the `stats.pending` ticker for, arriving
 * through a different door.
