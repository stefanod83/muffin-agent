#!/usr/bin/env sh
# muffin installer — one command, from an empty machine to a supervised agent.
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/muffin-project/muffin-agent/main/bootstrap.sh | sh
#   bash install.sh          # from a clone or an unpacked tarball
#
# ## What this script owns, and why it grew
#
# Until 2026-09-06 it owned exactly one thing: turning an *already cloned,
# already built-able* checkout into a `muffin` command. Everything before that
# (Node, git, the clone itself) and everything after it (`init`, the
# supervisor) was prose in `README.md` — which meant the only path anyone ever
# exercised was a developer's Mac with Node already on it. DAY-1 A11 is the
# opposite claim: an empty Ubuntu VPS, one command, `muffin doctor` green and
# the gateway running under systemd. So the script owns the whole line now:
#
#   1. OS packages     fetch/build prerequisites + platform-specific sandbox deps
#   2. Node >= 22      the official tarball under MUFFIN_PREFIX, never a system package
#   3. the source      git clone (or reuse) — `muffin update` needs a real checkout
#   4. the build       npm ci/install -> dist/
#   5. the command     a symlink in a user-writable bin dir, never sudo into /usr
#   6. the setup       `muffin init` (the key arrives on stdin, never argv/env)
#   7. the supervisor  `muffin gateway install --write --start`
#
# Steps 1-5 are unattended. Steps 6-7 need something only the owner has (an API
# key) or something only a real login session has (a user systemd instance), so
# each one degrades to a printed command rather than to a lie. The public
# `bootstrap.sh` exists solely to stage this file and restore the controlling
# terminal to stdin when the outer `curl | sh` consumed fd 0.
#
# ## Why the code does not live in the data home
#
# `~/.muffin` is the *data* home and `muffin uninstall` deletes it whole. A Node
# runtime or a git checkout under there would be erased by a command whose
# stated job is removing config, keys and memory — and the systemd unit's
# `Environment=PATH` points at this Node, so the erase would take the service
# with it. Hence MUFFIN_PREFIX (default `~/.local/share/muffin`), which
# `uninstall` does not touch and `./install.sh --uninstall` names on request.
#
# ## Modes and overrides (all optional)
#
#   --personal | --checkout               install mode; personal is the default
#                                         and never binds to a source checkout.
#                                         MUFFIN_MODE does the same from the env.
#   --paths                               print the resolved paths and exit
#   --uninstall                           remove this build's launcher symlink(s)
#
#   MUFFIN_PREFIX=~/.local/share/muffin   where the code and Node live
#   MUFFIN_BINDIR=~/.local/bin            where the launcher symlink goes
#   MUFFIN_CMD=muffin                     force the command name (see the Mint note)
#   MUFFIN_REPO=<git url>                 where to clone from
#   MUFFIN_CHANNEL=main                   which branch to install
#   MUFFIN_HOME=~/.muffin                 runtime data home; reported here, read
#                                         by the runtime, never touched by this
#                                         installer
#   MUFFIN_API_KEY_FILE=<path>            unattended setup: the key is read from
#                                         this file and piped into `muffin init`.
#                                         A path, never the value: a secret in an
#                                         env var is readable from /proc and ends
#                                         up in shell history (ADR-0048).
#   MUFFIN_NO_APT=1                       never call apt-get
#   MUFFIN_NO_GATEWAY=1                   install, but do not touch the supervisor
#   MUFFIN_NODE_DIST_BASE=<url>           test/mirror hook: distribution directory
#                                         the Node tarball AND its SHASUMS256.txt
#                                         are fetched from (default: nodejs.org).
#                                         The checksum gate applies either way.
#
# Exit codes: 0 done · 1 something failed · 3 installed, gateway NOT active.

# Two install modes, and the choice is **explicit** — the script never infers
# it from where it happens to sit:
#
#   personal (default)  code and Node under $MUFFIN_PREFIX; the launcher and
#                       `muffin update`'s releases stay there. A personal
#                       install never writes `.releases/` into a source clone.
#   checkout            only with `--checkout` (or MUFFIN_MODE=checkout): the
#                       launcher points at THIS checkout's `dist/`, and
#                       `muffin update` stores releases under its `.releases/`.

#
# Running this script from a clone used to select checkout mode silently, just
# because the directory contained Muffin's package.json (#702). Now the same
# run is a personal install and says so, with the one flag that changes it.

# shell too, not only inside this script. Two directories have to be on the
# login shell's PATH for that: the launcher's, and — measured on a fresh VPS
# on 2026-09-08, where `muffin` printed «/usr/bin/env: 'node': No such file»
# after a clean run of this very script — the bundled Node's, because the
# launcher is a symlink whose shebang resolves `node` through PATH. Printing
# an `echo … >> ~/.profile` for the owner to copy was the previous answer,
# and it left the second directory out. So the script writes the line itself,
# once (the marker keeps re-runs from stacking it), into the files login
# shells actually read: `~/.profile` (sh/dash/bash when no .bash_profile),
# `~/.bash_profile` when it exists (bash then skips .profile), `~/.zprofile`
# on macOS/zsh. Interactive shells already open need `. ~/.profile` or a new
# login — said below, not assumed.

# 6. Setup — `muffin init`.
#
# The API key reaches `init` on **stdin** and nowhere else: never argv (shell
# history, and every `ps` on the box), never an environment variable (/proc,
# and inherited by every child). `cmdInit` refuses both by name, so this is not
# a convention this file could quietly break — ADR-0048.
#
# An existing Home is NEVER re-initialised here, on any input mode: `init`
# used to rebuild the config from defaults, so accepting the prompt on an
# existing Home silently reset models/surfaces/provider routing and more
# (incident 2026-09-18 — `runInit` now preserves, but the installer still has
# no business re-running setup unasked). A deliberate reconfiguration is
# `muffin init` typed by the owner, never this prompt's default.
#
# Three cases, and the one that cannot get a key does not pretend:
#   · setup already exists → skip, continue to upgrade/supervisor/migration
#   · MUFFIN_API_KEY_FILE set → unattended, the file is piped in
#   · a terminal              → `init` runs and asks, hidden
#   · a pipe with no key file → print the one command and stop here

# 7. The supervisor.
#
# `muffin init` on a terminal already offers to *write* the unit; what it
# deliberately does not do is load it into the supervisor (ADR-0035: writing a
# file in your home and starting a service are different acts). At the end of a
# one-command install the answer is unambiguous — the whole promise of the
# command is a running agent — so this step does both, through the single
# command that also runs `loginctl enable-linger` and then *verifies a pid*
# instead of trusting `systemctl`'s exit code.
#
# When there is no user systemd instance to talk to (a container, a
# `sudo`-without-login shell), this cannot succeed and must not claim to: the
# script exits 3 and says which command is left. Three and not one, so a script
# driving this installer can tell "nothing works" from "everything works except
# the part this machine cannot do".
