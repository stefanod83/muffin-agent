/**
 * Slice 14 of the ingress decomposition
 * (`docs/evidence/ingresso-unico-e-nucleo-2026-09-05.md` §2.4, §3 row 14): the
 * router. The ingress twin `core/surface/registry.ts`'s `deliver` never got —
 * "il registro ha unificato **solo l'uscita**".
 *
 * ## Two entries, not one
 *
 * `drain()` already had two, so this has two. `receive` takes an event nobody
 * has claimed yet and walks it to an answer. `recover` takes one already bound
 * to a durable work id and resolves it **without ever calling the model** —
 * the five branches of Telegram's `resolveBound`, which are not expressible as
 * a fresh `InboundEvent` because their input is a turn row, not a message.
 *
 * `bind` itself deliberately stays in the port, exactly where it is today,
 * *between* the two: exactly-once belongs where the tables are (§4 invariant
 * 3), and the router is called after the event is already durable. It never
 * owns idempotency; it asks for a claim (`hooks.claim`) and believes the
 * answer.
 *
 * ## Why the stage list is an exported array
 *
 * `INGRESS_STAGES` is the axis slice 16's parity test iterates, and the thing
 * mutation tests remove an element from. It is therefore not decoration: this
 * module *iterates it* to decide what runs. Deleting `busy` from the array
 * deletes the pause check from production, which is what makes the parity test
 * a measurement instead of a restatement.
 *
 * ## What is deliberately not a stage
 *
 * Per §2.5: the group gate's *rule* (`apreUnTurno`) stays in the port and
 * arrives here as `hooks.opensATurn`; the poller-level command pre-emption
 * (`controlla`, `gestiti`, `markProcessed`) stays in the port, because a stage
 * walked once per already-durable event cannot reproduce a pre-emption over a
 * whole batch; and the fresh delivery goes through the port's own write-ahead
 * plan, never `SurfaceRegistry.deliver` — routing it there would write no
 * per-part rows (so a crash mid-answer could not tell `sent` from
 * `possibly_sent`) and would apply `redactText`, changing the bytes of the
 * answer without announcing it.
 */

/**
 * The ten stages, in the order they run. Iterated by `receive` below.
 *
 * `gate` and `remember` are a pair: the gate does not *stop* an event, it
 * diverts it — a group message that opens no turn must still be remembered
 * (ADR-0063's own named follow-up), and the remember stage is where that
 * happens. The divert is by name, so removing `remember` from this array
 * raises rather than silently letting a gated-out message walk on into a turn.
