/**
 * Slice 13 of the ingress decomposition
 * (`docs/evidence/ingresso-unico-e-nucleo-2026-09-05.md` §1.2 rows 6 and 7,
 * §3 row 13): the ownership of *live turn* state leaves the Telegram
 * connector.
 *
 * Three things move, and one deliberately does not.
 *
 *  - **The live-lane registry** (`LaneRegistry`). ADR-0054's "una chat, un
 *    turno alla volta" lever: an `AbortController` for `/stop` and a queue of
 *    corrections for `/steer`. It had *two* writers in the pre-slice
 *    connector, not one — the fresh turn (`runFresh`, which registers a lane
 *    before `runTurn` and removes it in its `finally`) and the resume branch
 *    (`resumeStream`, which reuses the lane already there and removes it only
 *    when it was the one that registered it) — and two readers: the "in coda"
 *    notice and the control commands. All four are here now.
 *  - **The queue notice** (`QueueNotices`). "In coda" / "in pausa", said once
 *    **per event**, never once per drain: two messages arriving while the
 *    same turn runs are two people-facing facts, and the pre-slice `avvisati`
 *    set keyed on the update id for exactly that reason.
 *  - **The command stitching** (`controlliPerCorsia`, `tryControlCommand`).
 *    `agent/comandi.ts` was already surface-agnostic and already served both
 *    `cli/repl.ts` and the Telegram connector; what was duplicated per port
 *    was the four lines around it — the owner check, building `Controlli` out
 *    of this conversation's lane, and handing the outcome back to whoever
 *    asked. Per §2.5 this extends the seam that already works rather than
 *    inventing a chat-only command module the terminal would never call.
 *
 * What stays in the port, by §2.5: `controlla` — the poller-level pre-emption,
 * `gestiti`, and `markProcessed`. A stage walked once per already-durable
 * event cannot reproduce a batch pre-emption, so moving it here would change
 * what `/stop` can interrupt.
 *
 * ## Why the key carries the port id (§4 invariant 5)
 *
 * Today's lanes are per connector: each connector owns its own map, so a
 * Telegram turn and a Discord turn are never the same lane. A shared registry
 * keyed on `identify()`'s `sessionKey` alone would silently end that, because
 * `OWNER_SESSION_KEY` is the literal `'owner'` on *every* port
 * (`core/surface/types.ts`): the owner's Telegram turn and the owner's
 * Discord turn would collapse into one live lane, `/stop` sent on one port
 * would abort a turn running on the other, and the second port's message
 * would answer "📥 in coda" to a turn it cannot see. That is a behaviour
 * change, and slice 13 is explicitly *not* "nessun comportamento nuovo": the
 * decision is to keep today's behaviour, and `laneKey` exists so that keeping
 * it is a call, not an accident.
 *
 * The second half of the key is the port's own conversation id, not
 * `sessionKey`, and that is the same decision made twice. `identify()`
 * suffixes `sessionKey` with `#<threadId>` for a forum topic, while the
 * pre-slice map was keyed on the chat id: two topics of one Telegram group
 * share one lane today. Keying on `sessionKey` here would split them into two
 * concurrent lanes — a real change to how many turns a group can run at once,
 * arriving as a side effect of a refactor. The port passes the id whose lane
 * shape it already has; only the prefix is added.
