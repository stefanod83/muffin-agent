 * from `~/Downloads/fattura.pdf` that arrived from a stranger: same `stat`, same
 * bytes, no field anywhere that separates them. Under that uncertainty the only
 * honest reading is the fail-closed one — *somebody who is not the owner may
 * have written this* — and that is what 2 means.
 *
 * **Not 1**, which is where the cost would have been lower and the guarantee
 * empty: at taint 1 an off-allowlist host still comes back as an `ask`
 * (`core/policy/decide.ts`), so a poisoned file could still nominate the
 * destination and wait for a tired yes. The whole chain closes at 2 and nowhere

 * owner typed is not a web page, 3 is the top of the scale and spending it here
 * leaves nothing to say about something genuinely worse — and it would put the
 * owner's own notes in the same bucket as an untrusted MCP server.
 *
 * **Not per-path** (`~/.muffin` clean, everywhere else dirty), which was the
 * tempting one: it is a rule you evade by *moving a file*, and it buys less
 * than it looks like. `skill.read` already gives the readable parts of the
 * muffin home their own door and their own tier; `denyRead` already blocks
 * the parts that must not be read (`secrets/`, the working directory's
 * `.env`) by name. **`rot/` and `config.json` are deliberately readable at
 * the same tier as anything else on disk — only `denyWrite` names them** —
 * because a read-only agent inspecting its own policy or config is not the
 * threat `denyRead` exists for (2026-08-16 audit, P29 LOW: this paragraph
 * used to say the opposite). A per-path rule would draw a line `denyRead`
 * already draws, one level up, and it would still launder a poisoned file the
 * moment anything wrote it inside the home.
 *
 * One constant, imported by `agent/tools/shell.ts` too, because a command's
 * stdout is the same disk read through a different door — and two literals that
 * agree today are how the two deny-lists in `core/rot/guards.ts` got written.

/**
 * The label every disk door fences under, and the one function that does it.
 *
 * **Why this exists at all.** `fence()` (`core/memory/spotlight.ts`) was called
 * by `http.ts`, `search.ts`, `mcp.ts` and `document.ts` — and by nothing on the
 * disk path. So the same bytes were marked as observed data when they arrived
 * over HTTP and arrived indistinguishable from the owner's own prose when they
 * were read off his disk, which is the door four of the seven scenes in
 * `evals/security/attacks` enter through: a PDF, a note, a document somebody
 * sent him and he saved. The comment on `fs.list` below already said it for
 * filenames — *"reaches the model through this door with no fence around it"* —
 * and it was equally true of the body.
 *
 * **What this buys, stated narrowly so it is not overclaimed.** The marking is
 * deterministic: code wraps the bytes, always, whatever the model is thinking.
 * The *obedience* is not — a fence tells the model these bytes are data, and
 * whether it treats them that way is its judgement. Fencing is provenance, not
 * prevention. It is the condition under which "content comes back marked as
 * external" is a true sentence about this system rather than a true sentence
 * about four of its doors.
 *
 * **One function, not a second implementation.** `shell.ts` imports this the
 * way it already imports `DISK_TIER`, because a command's stdout is the same
 * disk read through a different door. Two call sites that build the same
 * marker by hand are how a divergent marker gets shipped, and a divergent
 * marker is a fence the model has no reason to recognise.
 *
 * **No tier moves.** `DISK_TIER` is what it was, the effect rows are what they
 * were, and nothing became more or less allowed: the kernel decides on
 * `capability`, `resourceKind` and the turn's taint, never on the shape of a
 * tool's `content` string. `agent/decisioni-invariate-col-recinto.test.ts`

   * alone, which is a decision and not an omission.
   *
   * **Why not 1.** `web_search` and `sys.http` both carry 3 with a recorded
   * reason: the first result taints the turn to 3, so a lower ceiling would
   * permit exactly one fetch per turn and deep research would be impossible.
   * Reading a file is the same shape — *"leggi questa pagina e confrontala con
   * i miei appunti"* is a normal owner turn, and at a ceiling of 1 the second
   * half is refused. So the ceiling stays high and the **read itself pays**:
   * every read taints the turn to `DISK_TIER`, which is what a turn that has
   * swallowed unprovenanced bytes actually is.
   *
   * **The half of this argument that was fiction until ADR-0044, named so it
   * does not become fiction again.** The sentence used to be *"the read alone
   * is not the leak: the bytes still have to leave, and the egress leg is
   * separately gated — off-allowlist above taint 1 is DENY, never ask"*. True
   * of `core/policy/decide.ts`, and unreachable from here: that gate reads the
   * **turn's taint**, and `fs_read` returned no `tier`, so a turn that had just
   * read an injected file was still at taint 0 and the off-allowlist host came
   * back as an `ask` the owner could approve. The file's own security argument
   * rested on a property the file did not produce. It produces it now, and
   * `agent/read-then-egress.test.ts` is the thing that fails if it stops.
   *
   * **The precondition that makes it true, stated so it can be falsified.** The
   * ceiling is defensible because no *secret* is reachable inside `root`:
   * `denyRead` covers both secret stores and the working-directory `.env`
   * (`agent/runtime.ts`) — not `rot/` or `config.json`, which stay readable on
   * purpose (see the per-path rejection above). If a secret ever becomes
   * readable there again, this argument stops holding and the number has to
   * be revisited — that, and not the taint value, is the thing to watch.
   *
   * Deliberately *not* pinned to 3 in the declaration: pinning would override
   * an owner who tightened the `context` row in `rot/policy.json`, and the
   * file's one legitimate direction is tightening (`core/policy/matrix.ts`).
   * Since ADR-0053 a pin cannot widen anyway — the kernel takes the stricter of
   * row and pin — so a pin here would be inert as well as wrong.

 *  - `'reject'` (writes): a terminal symlink throws outright, wherever it
 *    points — a write has no legitimate reason to go through a link, and
 *    refusing it means there is nothing to resolve correctly or not.
 *
 * **2026-08-16 audit, P29 (CRITICAL) and P28 (MEDIUM).** The previous version

 * written for the write-terminal case (P28's precursor: a write must not
 * silently follow a link), but it ran unconditionally, for reads too (P29)
 * and for ancestors too (P28): `resolveInScope`'s containment and `denyRead`
 * checks ran on a path that was always inside `root` by construction — the
 * link's own — while `readFileSync`/`readdirSync`/`writeFileSync` followed it
 * to wherever it actually pointed. Every ancestor found by walking up is now
 * *unconditionally* resolved with plain `realpathSync`, which follows the

 * directory Git will execute hooks from). Both are resolved from the
 * enclosing repository's config at write time, so a nested checkout,
 * worktree or submodule is covered structurally without advance knowledge
 * of it existing.
 *
 * New delegations via any other command-bearing key (`core.fsmonitor`,
 * `core.sshCommand`, `diff.*.command`, `filter.*.clean/smudge`, …) still
 * require a `.git/config` write to take effect, which `isGitControlPath`

 * indirection case: the owner already points `include` or `hooksPath` at a
 * workspace path, and a write to that target alone would arm the next Git
 * command without touching any config.
 *
 * Includes resolve **recursively**: an included file is itself a config, so
 * its own `include.path` entries (relative to *its* directory, as Git
 * resolves them) and its `core.hooksPath` entries are collected too, with a
 * visited-set for cycles and a depth bound mirroring Git's own fatal
 * `maximum include depth (10)`. Value parsing follows Git's observed
 * semantics — unquoted `#`/`;` start a comment (even without a preceding
 * space), quoted segments preserve them, `\"`/`\\`/`\n`/etc. unescape both
 * inside and outside quotes — because a parser that keeps the comment while
 * Git strips it classifies a different path than the one Git will touch.
 *
 * Fail-closed: a present-but-unreadable config, an unresolvable `.git`, an
 * ambiguous control value, or a chain deeper than Git itself would follow
 * marks the checkout `uncertain`, and an uncertain checkout denies the
 * write. Checkouts with no such indirection stay exactly as permissive as
 * before — ordinary editing never sees this path deny.
