 *
 * `ingestPending` has been correct since `6ddba7c` and had one caller — a person
 * typing `muffin memory extract`. Every piece downstream of that caller had
 * tests; the thing that had no test was that production ever reached it, which
 * is this repository's signature defect (`AGENTS.md`: four defences with correct
 * logic and no caller). So the assertion here is deliberately end-to-end and
 * deliberately not about extraction quality: run a real turn through the real
 * loop, wait, and look in the real `facts` table.
 *
 * Verified to fail without the wiring: removing `announceEnd` from
 * `agent/loop.ts`'s `finish` turns "il consolidamento parte da solo" red and
 * leaves the rest of the suite green.
