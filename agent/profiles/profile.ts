 * permit: on the 5-series thinking is **on unless you disable it**, so `'off'`
 * that sends no field is a declaration the request contradicts, and `'allowed'`
 * described a budget the API deleted. `'adaptive'`, `'off'` and `'unset'` are
 * the three modes that exist now (ADR-0037, and its correction the same day):
 *
 * - `'adaptive'` → `{type:'adaptive'}`.
 * - `'off'` → `{type:'disabled'}` — **only where the model actually has a
 *   disable switch.** Claude Sonnet 5 and Claude Opus 5 (at `effort` high or
 *   below — nothing here sends `effort`, so this holds today, but the coupling
 *   is not enforced) do; Claude Fable 5 and Claude Mythos 5 do not — thinking
 *   is always on there and the API 400s on `{type:"enabled"}` **and**
 *   `{type:"disabled"}` alike (per-model table, read 2026-08-13). Sending
 *   `'off'` to one of those is not a degradation, it is a 400 every turn.
 * - `'unset'` → the field is **omitted**, not sent as `undefined`. The one
 *   value proven safe on every model, because it is what every model accepted
 *   before this field existed at all: for a model with a disable switch it
 *   behaves however that model defaults (usually thinking on, on current
 *   models); for one without, it is the only legal way to ask for "no
 *   configuration" instead of a request the model rejects outright. This is
 *   also ADR-0037's own reversibility plan ("`thinking` assente resta una
 *   forma valida") — before this value existed, no profile could reach that
 *   branch, because the loop passed the field unconditionally.
 *
 * `sampling` exists because `temperature: 0` was hardcoded in the loop and is a
 * **400** on Opus 4.7 and later — including `claude-sonnet-5`, which is what
 * `muffin init` writes on a default install. It is per-model data, so it lives
 * here for the same reason `thinking` does: never as `if (model === ...)` in
