/**
 * The joins `buildRuntime` is responsible for, asserted through a real turn.
 *
 * Two lines in `buildRuntime` used to carry the whole egress guarantee: the
 * one that hands the capability declarations to the loop, and the one that
 * hands the allowlist to the kernel. Delete either and the entire suite stayed
 * green — `sys.http` would be refused for everyone, always, silently, and
 * nothing said so. Both failed closed, so neither was a hole; both were total
 * outages that no test could notice.
 *
 * ADR-0066 removed the second line for `sys.http` specifically: `makeHttpTool()`
 * no longer takes `egress` at all, so there is no allowlist wiring left to
 * prove for it — the join that matters now is simpler (does `buildRuntime`'s
 * `sys.http` registration actually reach the kernel as `url-read`, through a
 * real installed home?) and the tests below prove exactly that: the same
 * fetch, real `rot/egress.json` present either way, same outcome. The lesson
 * that gave this file its name still holds for whatever the next `url`
 * (acting) capability turns out to be, and `homeAllowing`/`turnAgainst` below
 * are kept for that day.
