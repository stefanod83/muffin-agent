/**
 * The paid path: one round of the turn, repeated until something ends it.
 *
 * This is the half of `guidaIlTurno` that spends money and shows text. Slice 7
 * took the durable writes out; what was left in the closure was the loop
 * itself — the reply door, the `/steer` boundary, the model call, the stream
 * and its single non-streaming fallback, the completion gate, the answer, and
 * the batch of tool calls under the per-turn cap. It reads the same bindings
 * the durable writes do (`TurnScope`) plus seven the pre-loop resolved and
 * only it and this file share, so the two halves are named once and passed by
 * reference rather than reassembled per call.
 *
 * The order in here is the property, not a style. Three points of it are
 * load-bearing and are what this module is judged on:
 *
 *  - **The reply door is asked *before* the model call** (§4 inv. 7). A round's
 *    text streams out of that call as it is generated, so a decision taken
 *    after it would be taken about bytes already on the owner's screen. The
 *    `/steer` drain comes after the refusal for the mirror reason: draining
 *    first would eat the owner's correction into a transcript the refusal is
 *    about to discard.
 *  - **One fallback, never a second stream.** A broken stream falls back to a
 *    single plain `chat()` for *this* attempt. A transport retry is a different
 *    budget on a *later* iteration, which rebuilds `call` and may stream again
 *    — each attempt its own `muffin.chat_call` span. What must never exist is a
 *    second `chatStream` inside one attempt: the partial text of the first is
 *    already on a surface, and the surface is told `superseded` exactly once.
 *  - **The tool cap counts calls, not iterations.** Rounds continue while the
 *    turn is making progress; nothing upstream bounds how many `tool_use`
 *    blocks one completion carries, and a refused call still gets a
 *    `tool_result` because a hole in the batch is a protocol error every
 *    provider rejects.
 *
 * Owner-visible text is byte-identical to what the closure produced (§4 inv. 9):
 * every string in here moved without an edit.

           * (`core/memory/recall.ts`) separa lo speaker dal tier e rende un

           * recupero — non più «tu». Il codice si era mosso e il commento no;
           * una nota che predice un guasto già chiuso è il modo più efficiente
