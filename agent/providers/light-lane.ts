/**
 * The light lane's missing half of the loop.
 *
 * `agent/loop.ts` does two things around every `provider.chat` that have nothing
 * to do with the loop: it bills the call, and it turns the profile's `sampling`
 * into what the wire is allowed to carry. The memory lane — extraction, the
 * contradiction judge, the reranker — is a **second entry point to the same
 * provider** and got neither, so both defects were real and both were invisible:
 *
 *  - **Spend.** `recordSpend` is a `LoopDeps` field called only from the loop.
 *    `/spend`, the monthly cap and the kernel's `budget_exhausted` branch all
 *    read zero from the memory lane. That was tolerable while the only caller
 *    was a hand-typed `muffin memory extract`; ADR-0038 makes consolidation run
 *    by itself, repeatedly, with nobody watching, and an unattended lane outside
 *    the cap is the shape of the $47 echo loop `core/budget/budget.ts` names.
 *  - **Sampling.** `core/memory/{extract,judge,rerank}.ts` each hardcode
 *    `temperature: 0` outside the profile system. Legal only because the shipped
 *    light model is haiku 4.5; a 400 on every consolidation the day
 *    `--light-model` points at anything 4.7 or later, and — the part that makes
 *    it worse than the loop's old hardcode — *no profile edit can reach it*,
 *    because that lane never loads a profile at all.
 *  - **Retry ownership.** Both SDKs are constructed with `maxRetries: 0` now,
 *    which is correct for the main loop because `RoundScope` owns an explicit
 *    transport-retry budget. The light lane does not enter that loop. Without
 *    an owner here, turning off SDK retries silently changes extraction/judge/
 *    rerank from three bounded wire attempts to one. This wrapper therefore
 *    owns a separate, smaller retry budget for this entry point — transport
 *    failures only, never malformed model output — and shares the main lane's
 *    backoff primitive without inheriting its longer interactive budget.
 *
 * ## Why a wrapper and not a parameter threaded through the three files
 *
 * Threading `sampling`, retry and a spend callback through `extractFacts`,
 * `judgeContradiction` and `LlmReranker` fixes the three call sites that exist
 * today. It does nothing for the fourth. This repo's recorded failure is not a
 * wrong line, it is *a mechanism a later caller did not know to reach* — four
 * defences with correct logic and no caller (`AGENTS.md`). A boundary the light
 * provider is constructed behind cannot be forgotten by code that has not been
 * written yet: whatever calls `runtime.light.provider` is billed, retried and
 * legal on the wire, without knowing this file exists.
 *
 * The three `temperature: 0` literals stay where they are and keep meaning what
 * they say — *this job wants determinism*. This boundary is where that request
 * meets what the model accepts, exactly as the loop's `profile.sampling` spread
 * does for the main lane. Neither side guesses at the other.
